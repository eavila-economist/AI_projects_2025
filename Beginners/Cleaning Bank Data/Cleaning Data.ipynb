    "# Bank Marketing Data Cleaning Project\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "Personal loans represent a significant revenue source for banks. In the United Kingdom, the average interest rate for a two-year loan hovers around 10%. While this might appear modest, the scale of borrowing amplifies its impact—UK consumers borrowed approximately £1.5 billion in September 2022 alone, translating to roughly £300 million in interest revenue for banks over two years.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I collaborated with a bank to clean and prepare data collected during a recent marketing campaign promoting personal loans. The cleaned data will not only support the analysis of the campaign's outcomes but also serve as the foundation for a PostgreSQL database, ensuring seamless integration of data from future campaigns. By maintaining a consistent structure and conforming to strict data type requirements, the cleaned dataset enhances the bank’s ability to manage and analyze its marketing efforts.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "The raw data is provided in a CSV file named <code>bank_marketing.csv</code>. The goal of this project is to:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "<ol><li>Clean and reformat the raw data to meet the bank's requirements.</li>\n",
    "<li>Split the dataset into three logical subsets: client.csv, campaign.csv, and economics.csv.</li>\n",
    "<li>Prepare the data for seamless import into a PostgreSQL database.</li></ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Deliverables\n",
    "1. **client.csv** <br>\n",
    "Contains demographic and financial information about clients:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning Steps:<br>\n",
    "<ul><li>Replace . with _ in the job column.</li>\n",
    "<li>Replace . with _ and convert \"unknown\" values to NaN in the education column.</li>\n",
    "<li>Convert credit_default and mortgage columns to boolean data types (1 for \"yes,\" 0 otherwise).</li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **campaign.csv**<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Holds details of the current and previous marketing campaigns:<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "Cleaning Steps:<br>\n",
    "<ul><li>Convert campaign outcome-related columns to boolean data types (1 for \"yes\" or \"success,\" 0 otherwise).</li>\n",
    "<li>Create a <code>last_contact_date</code> column by combining day, month, and a newly generated year column (2022), formatted as <code>YYYY-MM-DD.</code></li></ul>\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **economics.csv**<br>\n",

    "Cleaning Steps:<br>\n",
    "<ul><li>Ensure consistent data types (float for numerical indicators).</li></ul>\n",

    "### Why Modular Functions?\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure the code is clean, reusable, and scalable, we use modular functions for each dataset's cleaning process. This approach provides several benefits:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Readability**: Each function has a single, well-defined purpose, making the code easier to understand.\n",
    "2. **Reusability**: If new datasets with similar structures are added in the future, these functions can be reused with minimal changes.\n",
    "3. **Maintainability**: Bugs or updates in a specific cleaning process can be addressed by modifying just one function without impacting the others.\n",
    "4. **Scalability**: This modular structure supports extending the project, such as adding new cleaning steps or datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Client Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_client_data` function focuses on processing demographic and financial information about clients. Here’s a breakdown of its key tasks and why certain decisions were made:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting Relevant Columns**:\n",
    "   - Only columns directly related to clients are selected to simplify the cleaning process and separate concerns across datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Cleaning the `job` and `education` Columns**:\n",
    "   - Replacing invalid characters (`.`) with underscores (`_`) ensures that column values conform to standard naming conventions, which is especially important for database integration or future analyses.\n",
    "   - Converting `\"unknown\"` to `NaN` in the `education` column explicitly marks missing values, aligning with best practices for handling missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Converting to Boolean Data**:\n",
    "   - Columns like `credit_default` and `mortgage` are converted to `bool` (`True`/`False`) to ensure consistency and compatibility with database storage, which often requires clear data types.\n",
    "   - `\"unknown\"` values are treated as `0` (`False`), assuming that missing or ambiguous responses do not indicate a default or a mortgage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Cleaning Campaign Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_campaign_data` function prepares data about marketing campaigns. Here are the main cleaning steps and their rationale:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Converting Outcomes to Boolean**:\n",
    "   - Columns like `campaign_outcome` and `previous_outcome` are mapped to `True`/`False` to simplify their interpretation and ensure compatibility with analysis tools and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Creating a `last_contact_date` Column**:\n",
    "   - A new column, `last_contact_date`, is created by combining `day`, `month`, and a fixed `year` (2022). This ensures the column aligns with the widely accepted `YYYY-MM-DD` format for dates.\n",
    "   - Using the `pd.to_datetime()` function validates the format, preventing potential errors during database storage or time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Dropping Unnecessary Columns**:\n",
    "   - Columns like `month`, `day`, and `year` are redundant after creating `last_contact_date`. Dropping them reduces storage size and improves clarity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Fix the Year to 2022?**\n",
    "- The year is fixed because the dataset is known to represent a single campaign conducted in 2022. This ensures consistency without requiring an additional input or assumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preparing Economics Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `clean_economics_data` function handles macroeconomic indicators, which require minimal cleaning. Key considerations include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Selecting Relevant Columns**:\n",
    "   - Only the `client_id`, `cons_price_idx`, and `euribor_three_months` columns are retained, as these are directly related to economic factors influencing the campaign.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Ensuring Consistent Data Types**:\n",
    "   - Ensuring that all numerical columns are stored as `float` ensures compatibility with analytical tools and prevents issues with mixed data types.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process and Save Data\n",
    "\n",
    "The `process_bank_marketing_data` function orchestrates the entire cleaning workflow. It performs the following tasks:\n",
    "1. **Loading Raw Data**:\n",
    "   - The `pd.read_csv()` function is used to load the dataset, ensuring efficient handling of CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Calling Modular Functions**:\n",
    "   - Each dataset is cleaned using its respective function (`clean_client_data`, `clean_campaign_data`, and `clean_economics_data`), maintaining a clear separation of concerns.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Saving Cleaned Data**:\n",
    "   - The cleaned datasets are saved as individual CSV files (`client.csv`, `campaign.csv`, `economics.csv`), ready for database integration or further analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why Save Data in Separate CSV Files?**\n",
    "- Splitting the data into logical tables aligns with relational database design principles, where different aspects of information (clients, campaigns, and economics) are stored in separate tables to optimize queries and reduce redundancy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### General Insights and Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Using `.map()` for Mapping Values**:\n",
    "   - The `.map()` method is preferred over `.apply()` for value mapping because it is faster and more concise when handling simple mappings.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Avoiding `inplace=True`**:\n",
    "   - Modern pandas practices discourage the use of `inplace=True` due to its potential side effects and ambiguity. Instead, the modified DataFrame is returned or reassigned.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explicit Type Conversions**:\n",
    "   - Converting columns to boolean or datetime types ensures consistency and prevents issues during analysis or storage in strongly-typed databases like PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Ensuring Reproducibility**:\n",
    "   - The use of functions and clear workflows makes the code reproducible and adaptable for other datasets or campaigns.\n"
