# Super Bowl Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This beginner-friendly project explores Super Bowl data from 52 games (up to 2018) to uncover interesting insights about:
- TV viewership trends.
- Game competitiveness based on point differences.
- Halftime show performances by top artists.

The project demonstrates foundational skills in:
- Data analysis with Python.
- Data visualization using Matplotlib.
- Writing clean, reusable code.

## Datasets
The analysis uses three datasets:
1. **tv.csv**: TV viewership statistics and advertisement costs.
2. **super_bowls.csv**: Details about each Super Bowl game, including scores and point differences.
3. **halftime_musicians.csv**: Information about halftime show performers.

## Key Findings
- Super Bowl viewership has steadily increased over the years.
- A few games have had unusually high point differences, indicating blowouts.
- Justin Timberlake has performed the most halftime show songs!

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository.
2. Install required dependencies: <code>pip install requirements.txt</code>
3. Open the notebook and explore the analysis.

## Future Improvements
- Extend the analysis with more recent Super Bowl data.
- Add interactive visualizations with Plotly or Dash.
